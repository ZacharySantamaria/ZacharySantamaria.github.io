## Installation
The first step is to get **hugo** and `git` installed. You can skip those sections if you already have those applications installed.

Instead I will redirect you to those instructions and you can comeback when that portion is completed. Here are the links for installation [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/installation/) and [git](https://github.com/git-guides/install-git)
