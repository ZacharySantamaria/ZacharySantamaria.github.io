# Introduction
Have you ever wondered, man I wish I could get a job. Well now you can! This post will show someone how to create a website using hugo and have it hosted with github actions. Once you have a blog page you can start posting about all the cool things you learn. This can not only make you more knowledgeable in the field but it also could help someone who needs a guide learning what you have. 


# Why Github?
**ITS FREE**!  
Also, it's the most common remote code repository so, nearly everyone has an account. Leading to more familiarity with the project and the tools github provides. Not that you'll need money anyways once your interviewer finds your blog page and sees your work.     

# Why hugo?
There are many reason to use hugo is because its impressive organization they use in order to maintain blog posts. Let's say you're lazy, which is more than likely true if you are using this post, this is where hugo's features shine. Creating post are easy with the use of a simple command, which we will explore later. Also, you can easily maintain posts and easily add a theme so you can just worry about posting.

# Steps
## Installation
The first step is to get **hugo** and `git` installed. You can skip those sections if you already have those applications installed. Now normally I do not mind showing y'all how to install these applications. However, they have great documentation so it seems redundant to show they same steps they have already documented. Instead I will redirect you to those instructions and you can comeback when that portion is completed. Here are the links for installation [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/installation/) and [git](https://github.com/git-guides/install-git)
